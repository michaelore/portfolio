<h2>Robot Simulator</h2>
<p>This is a simulation of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition">FRC</a> robot. I created it while participating in my high school's FRC team. As an exercise for the programming team, we discussed how to program a robot to drive with pivoting wheels. I didn't have a good grasp of how the pivoting would affect the steering, so I decided to extend the <a href="../../toys/duck/">Spinnning Duck</a> program I had written earlier to act as a simulator for such a robot. The virtual robot is programmed in the simplest way I could think of; the keyboard acts as essentially a direct interface to the motors. I wrote it in such a way that the programming could be changed independently of the physics, so that the simulation could be used as a test bed for different driver interfaces. We never ended up going any further with it, as we decided to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">Mecanum wheels</a>.</p>
