<h2>ISU Smithsonian Folklife Festival Exhibit</h2>
<p>This was a complex project undertaken by ISU's College of Design. I was recruited into the project's technical team. The exhibit contains four touch screen displays, each running a web-based game with the goal of cultivating design ideas for improving local communities. Users may select ideas from a pre-constructed list, or provide custom ideas to iPad-toting technicians. Either way, their idea is soon displayed on a circular marquee on the top of the exhibit. I was tasked with setting up a central web server to serve the game content to the displays, and to queue and display the design ideas.</p>
<p>I implemented the marquee queueing by adapting some Erlang and Javascript <a href="../../toys/erljax/">code</a> I had written earlier, to explore real-time syncing of webpages for multiple users.</p>
