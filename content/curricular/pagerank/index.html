<h2>Pagerank</h2>
<p>This is an implementation of Google's PageRank algorithm for ranking web pages by importance, for a discrete math course at Iowa State University. The input to the program is a list of ordered pairs which represent hyperlinks from one webpage to another. The program then builds a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a> modeling a user that randomly clicks links for a while. The output is a vector which, when normalized, is a probability distribution that represents the change of the Markov user landing on each page.</p>
<p>This implementation is written in C. I cannot include the source or binary, but a PowerPoint presentation I made as a report, which includes graphs showing performance for different input and parameters, is below.</p>
