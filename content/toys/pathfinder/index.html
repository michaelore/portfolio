<h2>Word Path Finder</h2>
<p>This is a fully general solution to a problem asked by an introductory statistics instructor. The question asked was, "How can the word 'STAT' by transformed into the word 'GLEE' by changing only one letter at a time, such that each intermediate form is a real word?". The program reads a dictionary file (such as those commonly included with Linux), and uses it to construct a graph connecting all words that have the same length and are only one letter apart. It then uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Breadth First Search</a> to find the shortest possible path connecting the two input words.</p>
