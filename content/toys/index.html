<h2>Toys</h2>
<p>I've just begun to sift through the projects I've worked on over the years. I'm starting with my hobbyist projects, those I've done purely for fun. I call them "toys" but they are, in my opinion, just as important as the projects in the other categories. These are the projects that distinguish me the most, as they represent what I'd like to work on in the absence of external pressures such as practicality and working with other developers. That said, I have on multiple occasions adapted code from a "Toy" into a more useful project. I adapted the Spinning Duck into my <a href="<%= @site.config[:base_url] %>/extracurricular/robot/">Robot Simulator</a> and the <a href="<%= @site.config[:base_url] %>/toys/erljax/">Erlang/Ajax Toy</a> into some of the code for the <a href="<%= @site.config[:base_url] %>/extracurricular/smithsonian/">ISU Smithsonian Folklife Festival Exhibit</a>. The code for all of these is available at my <a href="http://www.github.com/michaelore/">GitHub account</a>.</p>
