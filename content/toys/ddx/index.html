<h2>Symbolic Differentiation</h2>
<p>This is a symbolic differentiation and simplification system written in Emacs Lisp. In accordance with Lisp's code-as-data philosophy, it operates on Lisp's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expressions</a>. It makes good use of macros to make extension easier. After a few more functions are added, the differentiation module should work on any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function">Elementary Function</a>. Unfortunately, the output of the differentiation module is often very complex and the simplification module does not work well on many inputs. I worked out how to do these two tasks by thinking about how I do them myself. I did not consult the existing literature on computational algebra in doing this, though I may do so someday for comparison's sake.</p>
